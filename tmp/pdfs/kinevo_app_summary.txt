KINEVO APP - ONE-PAGE REPO SUMMARY
Generated from repository evidence only

WHAT IT IS
Kinevo is a trainer-student fitness platform split into a web app for workout prescription and student
management, plus a mobile app for workout execution and logging. It uses Supabase for auth/data and
includes Stripe subscription gating in the web product.

WHO IT IS FOR
Primary persona: strength coaches/personal trainers who prescribe structured programs, with students
as execution users in the mobile app.

WHAT IT DOES
- Trainer web dashboard with auth-protected access and student list management.
- Exercise library with system plus trainer-owned exercises and muscle group metadata.
- Program template builder (programs, workouts, ordered items: exercise/superset/note).
- Program assignment flow from templates to student-specific assigned programs/workouts/items.
- Mobile workout player with per-set logging (load, reps, completion), finish flow, and feedback.
- Mobile home/history/profile tabs, including support via WhatsApp deep link.
- Stripe checkout + webhook subscription sync; inactive subscriptions are redirected to blocked page.

HOW IT WORKS (ARCHITECTURE)
- Monorepo workspaces: web (Next.js App Router), mobile (Expo Router/React Native), shared
  (TypeScript types), supabase/migrations (database schema).
- Web data path: server components/routes call Supabase SSR clients; middleware guards sessions;
  Stripe API routes create checkout/portal flows and webhook handlers upsert subscription state.
- Mobile data path: Supabase JS with SecureStore-backed session persistence; screens/hooks load active
  programs/sessions and submit workout logs.
- Database model includes trainers, students, exercises, program templates, assigned snapshots,
  workout_sessions, set_logs, and subscriptions with RLS policies.
- Offline resilience signals in schema: sync_status + local_id/device_id fields for sessions and set logs.
